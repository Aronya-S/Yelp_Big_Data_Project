# Yelp Reviews Big Data Project (CIS 4130)

The data set that Iâ€™ve chosen to work with for my project is the Yelp data set. This data set includes a vast segment of information about businesses and users who use Yelp. Specifically, it includes data about the business itself, check-in data, reviews, tips, and user data, amongst other things.

## Dataset
This project was created using the Yelp Open Dataset, which includes 5 JSON files.
