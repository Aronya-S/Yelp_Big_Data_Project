# Yelp_Big_Data_Project
The data set that Iâ€™ve chosen to work with for my project is the Yelp data set. This data set includes a vast segment of information about businesses and users who use Yelp. Specifically, it includes data about the business itself, check-in data, reviews, tips, and user data, amongst other things.
