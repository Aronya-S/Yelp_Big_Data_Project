# Yelp Review Ratings Big Data Project (CIS 4130)

The data set that I’ve chosen to work with for my project is the Yelp data set. This data set includes a vast segment of information about businesses and users who use Yelp. Specifically, it includes data about the business itself, check-in data, reviews, tips, and user data, amongst other things.

## Dataset
This project was created using the Yelp Open Dataset, which includes 5 JSON files.

Using this data set, I will try to predict if a star rating of a review is “good” or not.  Specifically, this means predicting if the star rating is greater than three stars or not based on the text of the review written, the star rating of the business itself, the business’ total count of reviews, as well as other attributes of the business. To achieve this, I will use a logistic regression model since this will be a binary classification prediction.
